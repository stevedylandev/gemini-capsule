# Hello Gemini

I think I came across Gemini a while back and thought it was a novel idea, but didn't take the time to really explore it. That changed this past weekend when I stumbled across a post about the Konpeito tapes. The idea that there were tapes only accessible through an alternative internet protocol just fascinated me. I also recently got into cassette tapes as a whole, both collecting and recording. Ever since my discovery I've had the pleasure of listening to Winter 2021 the way it was intended, and every time I do I think about the little server running out there somewhere keeping those tapes alive.

It's fitting that the protocol was named Gemini after the NASA missions in the 1960s. If you're not familar with them, they were the last set of missions before the Apollo missions where we went to the moon. The Gemini missions had to test all the things that they would need to do in order to get to the Moon, with advance objects like docking spacecraft. My favorite was the first EVA, aka spacewalk.

The capsule was tiny. The astronauts just opened the small door, and with a tether hooked up to the ship, walked out into the nothingness of space. Truly going where no man had gone before.

In some ways I feel the same about this protocol. It's "new" and yet in some ways its where we've already been. I'm likely to keep using the web, but I'm also interested in what I can find here that isn't anywhere else.
